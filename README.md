## Getting started

### Requirements

#### Python

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) using your package manager of choice, or by downloading an installer appropriate for your system from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and running it.

#### pip

If you're using a recent version of Python, the Python package manager, [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), is most likely installed by default. However, you may need to upgrade pip to the lasted version:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip

If you need to install pip for the first time, download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py). Then run the following command to install it:

    $ python get-pip.py
